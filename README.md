made for introduction_to_programming

for anyone using this:

needs pygame, https://www.pygame.org/

CC BY-NC-ND license applies, see more at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode

this allows you to copy the program and test it but it definitely does not allow you to (modify and) submit it as your own project ;)
